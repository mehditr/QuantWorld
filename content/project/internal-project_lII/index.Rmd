This is the ggplot using an open-source article in finance and how to use it.

```{r}
#install.packages("MASS")
#library(MASS)
#library(ggplot2)
#head(Cars93)
library(tidyverse)
bike<- read.csv('bikeshare.csv')
# now we can create a plot
head(bike)
#ggplot(penguins,aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm,color=species))+
  #geom_point()

```
